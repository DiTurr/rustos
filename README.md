# Target HW:
Target is RISC-V RV64IMAFDC (riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf):
 - RV64: 64-bit base integer instruction set (registers and addresses are 64-bit).
 - I: Base Integer instructions (required).
 - M: Integer Multiplication and Division.
 - A: Atomic instructions (for concurrency).
 - F: Single-precision floating-point instructions.
 - D: Double-precision floating-point instructions.
 - C: Compressed instructions (16-bit versions of common instructions to save space).

So RV64IMAFDC is a 64-bit RISC-V core with support for integer arithmetic, atomic operations, and floating-point math (both single and double precision), plus compressed instructions.
